## This is a web app project that I initially did in React course.

I got the idea to do the project using Vanilla Javascript. <br>
In the course of doing the project, I did the following tasks: <br>
<li>I created the HTML markup for the web app and I styled it using CSS Flexbox and GRID. <br>
<li>In my JS code, I set my variables of the "card-container" and "search-input".</li>
<li>I used "FETCH API" to fetch data and images from an online free API websites and I returned my data in "json" format.<li>
<li>I then created some elements dynamically in JS and I set the content of those elements to specified
  "object values" I got from the data fetched.<li>
 <li>I append the dynamic elements to their appropriate parents so that they will be displayed in the 
   browser.</li>
 <li>I then used Javascript Array method - "map", to return the data in a new array whereby I returned the dynamically created elements.</li>
 <li>I then add an "event listener" to the "search-bar" such that when the user inputs each letters, the "if-else" conditional statements 
    will check if each item in our Array matches the letters inputted and this will either add or remove a dynamic class to the "card element" in our array.</li>
